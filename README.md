# 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection with SQL + Python

This project implements a **financial fraud detection system** using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It covers the entire process from data exploration to building and evaluating the final predictive model.

---

## 📌 Main Features
- **Data exploration and cleaning**.
- **Feature engineering** to improve model performance.
- **Model training and evaluation** with algorithms such as XGBoost.
- **Model persistence** for production use.
- **Data visualization and dashboards** for analysis.
